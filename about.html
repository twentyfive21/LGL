            <h4>EVAN ALDRIDGE | OWNER OF LOOKING GOOD LANDSCAPING</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Evan, and I'm the creator of Looking Good Landscaping.
                I have been a Landscape Crew Leader of a multi-state company for over five years.
                I have extensive experience in everything landscape related from grass, weeds, planting, trimming, maintenance, and etc.
                If you name it, I've done it. 
                My desire in creating Looking Good Landscaping was to cut out the middle man between customers, companies and the landscaper.
                I want to communicate directly with my employers to know exactly what they want, and give them just that.
                I am passionate about doing good, hard work, and offering affordable services.
                I want my customers to be proud of what their home or workplace.
                I look forward to helping make your next project come to life.</p>
