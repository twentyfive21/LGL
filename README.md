# Landscaping Website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

# Overview
This is the link to my site : [ ]
### This landscaping website is made for one of my good friends Evan who is in the landscaping business. This site takes on a modern design and is smooth for users to navigate. I wanted to implement a site that was sleek since many of the ones I have seen were generic and plain. This site uses the following languages that a front end developer must master. The following languages used in this site are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to note that HTML and CSS are considered markup languages and are not actual programming languages. The only language that is a actual programming language is Javascript. I utilized VSCODE (Visual Studio Code) since a simple text editor would not be as productive in syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and so much more.

Here is a little explanation of the languages for any beginners out there! If you have any questions or tips please reach out to me! I would appreciate any feedback to help me learn more. 

HTML stands for hypertext markup language and is used as the foundation to define the structure of webpages. To explain it in simpler terms it is the beams that hold up your house. It is used to create your paragraphs, headings, footers, and so much more.

CSS stands for cascading style sheets and it is used to style your webpages. For example, it is the color of your walls and the decorations you have around your house. This is the language that brings your site to life and makes it look beautiful. CSS alters the size of your font, background color, and so much more. Without this your page ends up looking like you created it in microsoft word. 

#### Javascript is used by many programmers around the world to make the document more interactive and responsive. This language makes your page more functional and dynamic. For someone who may not still get it this is the elevator that moves up and down.

The page has a homepage, about us, contact us, projects, and a services page. I faced many challenges making this, but I came out with so much more knowledge. I have made a few simple pages for fun in the past, but this is my first page that is being displayed to actual clients. In the future I hope to be able to implement more css and Javascript to see how far my skills have grown. I also had a team member who helped contribute to this project shoutout to Noel for helping me get this done! I also learned alot using GIT and GITHUB with him for the first time.
